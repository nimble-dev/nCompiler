## Newer predefined system (as of 3/15/22).
# How to to create a new predefined class:
# 1. Enter the class definition in a file in the R directory.
#    Some are in zzz_NC_predefined.R but they can be anywhere after nClass has been defined.
#
# 2. Include a classname in the nClass call, so it is not randomly generated.
#    Include a argument like predefined="my_predefined_local" in the nClass call,
#                            with a character value that is different from classname.
#    Be sure the nClass is an exported R object in the package (usually).
#    The class name will be used for the C++ code that will be generated each time you use the nClass.
#    The predefined name will be used for permanent files of generated C++ that you will copy to package source code and modify.
#    The example here will be my_predefined <- nClass(classname = "my_predefined", predefined = "my_predefined_pkg", ...)
#
# 3. build nCompiler again with the new nClass included.
#
# 4. Load nCompiler and do nCompile(my_predefined, control = list(generate_predefined = TRUE)).
#    Be sure you know where code is being generated (default is tempdir(), can be changed by dir argument to nCompile).
#    Note that the results from nCompile(my_predefined, control = list(generate_predefined = TRUE)) will not result in
#     usable objects right in the current R session. That is because the generated code will lack the interface calls such as
#     get_value, set_value, and call_method. The reason is that these must only be created once in any compilation,
#     and when the predefined nClass is used later, it should not be the place where those functions are defined.
#     If you want to test the predefined class, include some other nFunction or nClass in the call to nCompile.
#     Since that will not be predefined, it will trigger inclusion of the interface functions.
#     See test-predefined.R for examples.
#
# 5. Copy my_predefined.h (or my_predefined_c_.h) to my_predefined_pkg.h in package source code (i.e. inst/include/nCompiler).
#
# 6. Copy the cpp file, which will have an automatically generated name like "nCompiler_units_1.cpp", to
#    my_predfined_pkg.cpp in the package source code. (Note these names match the predefined argument in the nClass class.)
#
# 7. (DEPRECATED - DO NOT DO THIS. LEAVING IT HERE FOR NOTES)
#    In my_predefined.cpp, there will be a line like
#    #include "my_predefined.h"
#    Change that to
#    #include "my_predefined_pkg.h"
#    i.e. replace the classname with the predefined name.
#
# 8. In my_predefined.h and my_predefined.cpp, there will be #ifndef protections against
#    multiple #includes.  They will look like
#    #ifndef __test_predefined_H
#    #define __test_predefined_H
#    and
#    #ifndef __test_predefined_CPP
#    #define __test_predefined_CPP
#
#    Change each of these to have a unique name in some way, e.g.
#    #ifndef __test_predefined_H_PREDEF
#    #define __test_predefined_H_PREDEF
#    and similarly for the CPP one
#
# 8. If any other files (which must be included from nCompiler_Eigen_fxns.h)
#    in inst/include/nCompiler that need to use my_predefined,
#    put the code using my_predefined inside a code block like this:
#    #ifdef PREDEFINED_my_predefined
#    #include PREDEFINED_HEADER(PREDEFINED_test_predefined)
#    <rest of your code>
#    #endif
#
#    (The C++ pre-processor variable PREDEFINED_my_predefined will be set by generated code
#     automatically when you use the predefined class later.  In this case it will be 'my_predefined_pkg')
#
#    Note that it will not work to put such code just anywhere.  It needs to be in one of the files that
#    will be arranged to be included after the predefined header, so that
#    PREDEFINED_my_predefined has been defined for the C++ preprocessor
#    Currently the only file included at that time is nCompiler_Eigen_fxns.h, which is simply a set
#    of other include statements.  So it should be possible to add to those as needed (and possibly rename).
#
# 9. build nCompiler again so that the package includes the new .h and .cpp files.
#
# 10. You should now be able to use my_predefined as a type in nClasses and nFunctions.
#
# 11. When calling nCompile with code that uses my_predefined, include my_predefined as a compilation unit
#     (i.e. an input) to nCompile.  Otherwise it will not be used and there will be an error.
#
# Note: It is still possible to set control = list(generate_predefined = TRUE) and use
# locally generated versions of the predefined classes, not the versions that you have
# copied into package sources and installed.  However, other functions that uses the classes
# will not work.
#
# Note: During experimental work, in steps 5 and 6 you can copy the files directly to the installed directory
#       and then not need to rebuild and resintall the package in order to try them.
