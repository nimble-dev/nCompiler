Since nCompiler requires a C++ tool chain anyway, which should also be sufficient for installing a package from source, it is expected that each user's system can install this package.  You might think that compiled code for linking could be included in the nCompiler package itself, but this is surprisingly difficult and operating-system-dependent."

#' will be used.  If \code{installInR} is \code{FALSE}, then \code{dir} will also be the location of of the installed

#' @param installInR \code{TRUE} if nCompLocal should be installed as a regular package in R.  Generally, this is a

#' 
#' Create and install nCompLocal package, which contains a static dynamic library (DLL)
#' on each user's machine for nCompiler-generated C++ to link to.
#'
#' @details nCompiler is faster and simpler if it can link on-the-fly C++ compilation to a static library
#' on each user's machine.  That static library is nCompLocal.  It is a somewhat unusual R package.  It
#' does not contain any R source code.  It does not contain the type of compiled shared library that packages
#' with C or C++ source code typically do.  Instead it contains a \code{staticLib} directory with a static
#' library.
#' 
#' A typical R package would not assume that a user's system has the compiler tools to build a package 
#' including C++ source code from source.  Since nCompiler requires compiler tools anyway, it is reasonable
#' to assume that dynamically building a package from source will work.
