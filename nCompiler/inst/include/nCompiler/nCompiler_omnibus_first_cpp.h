// This file will manage includes that need to happen first,
// based on flags that have been set.
//
// Such use of flags may seem to risk complication, but in this
// case it simplifies what needs to be generated on the fly,
// and we hope the flags are readable.
//
// Both Rcpp and cereal have needs for the order of inclusion
// so that all template overloads are forward-declared before use.
// Rcpp manages this by saying to include RcppCommon.h first,
// then add any templates such as wrap or Exporter, then
// include Rcpp.h.
//
// It is assumed that Rcpp support is ALWAYS needed.
// Others (nClass interface, Eigen, cereal, TBB, and CppAD) are managed by flags.
//
// Note that aside from the sequencing needed for template purposes just stated,
// and for keeping simple the on-the-fly generated code,
// we attempt to make each header self-contained. It is hoped this practice
// will keep things a bit more sane and clear and avoid more complicated
// assumptions or schemes about order of includes.
