## Welcome

Welcome to nCompiler.  This package grew out of `nimble`, which includes a C++ code-generation system called the "nimble compiler".

This manual includes an overview of nCompiler's design, what works, and future plans.

For many features, the effort so far has been to create a skeleton of core functionality.  The goal is to see how the pieces fit together before fleshing them all out.
