```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

`nCompiler` generates C++ function and class definitions.  For management of C++ compilation, we use tools provided by Rcpp.

Particularly nice features of Rcpp's system include:

- automatically generating an R function to call each C++ function.
- a cache system, so a request to compile code that has already been compiled will automatically use the previous result.
- C++ attributes (code like `//[[Rcpp::depends(Rcereal)]]`) and plugins that are processed to help with things like finding include and link dependencies.
- a plugin system that supports managing options via environment variables rather than Makevars files.
- on the C++ side, a templated system for copying arguments in and out of compiled code (`as<>` on input and `wrap<>` on output), which can and has been extended for `nCompiler` needs (e.g. for Eigen tensors).

Note that `nCompiler` does not use Rcpp's modules to interface to C++ class objects.  There are some different needs in this regard, so a new system, with some aspects inspired by Rcpp, was written.
