# Storage format notes:
#  - spam only stores matrices in compressed row storage format
#  - Matrix can store matrices in compressed row/col format (and more), with a 
#    default of compressed col format
#  - SparseM also supports compressed row/col format
#
#  - spam provides methods to convert between sparse matrix classes, such as 
#      spam::as.dgCMatrix.spam(x) to go to Matrix format from spam format.  
#      Other conversions are possible, including to/from spam, Matrix, and 
#      SparseM classes.  The function spam::as.spam can also do some 
#      conversions into spam class objects.  See help('foreign', 'spam') 
#      and help('as.spam', 'spam') for more details.

# Modeling support notes:
#   - for practical use of sparse matrix methods, we will probably need to 
#     support conversion between different classes that represent sparse
#     matrices within R.
# 
#   - spam provides methods to generate sparse matrices useful for analyses, 
#     such as precision matrices for 1st order random walks via 
#     spam::precmat.RW1, and others.  The SparseM package contains generators 
#     for other types of sparse matrices as well.

# Roadmap to extend Rcpp supported types (new, published 4/2021):
#   - overall, though, not sure this necessarily buys us much
# 
#   - some demo code out there suggesting how to build additional support within
#     Rcpp, natively, for different R classes that express sparse matrices:
#     https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/04/constructing-a-sparse-matrix-class-in-rcpp/
#
#     OR copied here:
#     https://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/sparse-matrix-class/
#
#   - demo code also refers to a forthcoming RcppSparse package, which is on 
#     github and appears to be under active development:
#     https://github.com/zdebruine/RcppSparse.  
#     however, the package appears to be relatively sparse at the moment, and 
#     not published to CRAN
#
#  - additionally, the Rcpp gallery has many different stubs and initial demos 
#    for allowing some basic support for sparse matrices via Eigen:
#    Search "sparse eigen" on https://gallery.rcpp.org
