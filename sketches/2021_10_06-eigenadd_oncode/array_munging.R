# ok, but R warns that vector recycling is uneven (and array structure is lost)
Z = as.matrix(Y) + as.numeric(X)

# *should* we implement a componentwise operation when the input tensors
# have different numbers of elements in addition to different numbers of 
# dimensions?  if so, then it seems like we should use vector recycling ideas,
# but as seen above, R has some restrictions here as well.

# error; non-conformable arrays

# error still occurs even though the two arrays have the same number of elements
c(lenX = length(X), lenY = length(Y))

# fine, but of course, the array structure is lost
